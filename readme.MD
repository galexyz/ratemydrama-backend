# RateMyDrama backend

This project is built using:
- nnodeJS
- Sequelize ORM
- docker
- postgresQL

# Background Info
- Built a bunch of Rest APIs connecting to a postgresQL.
- MVC project structure
- personal thoughts: Sequelize ORM feels abit verbose when making more complex queries, 
might try prisma



## Getting started

1. ensure you have cloned the repo
2. `docker compose build` to build containers
3. `docker compose up -d` to run containers

## Future steps:
